    <p>In my free time, I enjoy engaging in a variety of hobbies that not only provide relaxation but also contribute to my personal growth. Here are a few activities that I am passionate about:

        <ul>
            <li>Coding and Side Projects:**
                - I love exploring new technologies and working on personal coding projects. It's a great way for me to experiment and enhance my skills.
             
            <li>Reading:**
                - I find solace in a good book. Whether it's fiction for escapism or non-fiction to learn something new, reading is a constant in my life.</li> 
             
            <li>Outdoor Activities:**
                - Embracing the outdoors is essential for balance. Hiking, jogging, or just spending time in nature helps clear my mind and rejuvenate my spirit.</li> 
             
            <li>Music and Podcasts:**
                - I have a diverse taste in music, and I also enjoy podcasts that cover topics ranging from technology trends to personal development.</li> 
             
            <li>Photography:**
                - Capturing moments through the lens is a hobby I find both creative and fulfilling. It allows me to appreciate the beauty in everyday life.</li>
